# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview
A Colorado Board of Elections employee has asked us to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election. If the audit is successfully automated using Python, the code will be used to audit not only other congressional districts, but also senatorial districts and local elections. We have been given the following tasks:

1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2. Get a complete list of candidates who recieved votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate recieved.
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.
